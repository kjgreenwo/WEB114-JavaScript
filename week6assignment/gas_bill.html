    <h1> What is the purpose of a function? </h1>
    <h2>The purpose of a function rests in the ability to reuse code. If one were to make a function to code putting together a sandwich, they would only have to make one block of code within the function and later reuse it with specific parameters rather than writing slightly different code over and over.</h2>
